3839-Vintage is a Signature Exclusive Sunbrella indoor/outdoor solid.  Vintage is a fabulous solid texture woven with performance Sunbrella 100% solution dyed all-weather acrylic yarns. This texture has weave irregularities that were intentionally designed into the fabric that add a hand-woven, vintage appearance to it.  Richard Frinier created  these understated patterns to work for a variety of applications to evoke the romantic elegance of Provence.
