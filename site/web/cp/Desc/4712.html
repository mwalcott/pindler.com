4712-Lunette is an Exclusive Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor small scale chenille.  Lunette was inspired by a Japanese kimono found in the textile archives of Doris Duke. This kimono dates to the Meiji period (1868-1912), and is an aizome indigo batik. This traditional classic design element is referred to as little ocean waves or half-moons in Japan.  The Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor Collection is an eclectic assortment of exotic patterns inspired by the batiks, sarongs, kimonos, and personal gatherings of an iconic world traveler, Doris Duke.  We have incorporated different weaves and structures to emulate the documents, adding touches of chenille, shading, and texture to make the fabrics that much more interesting.  Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor is wonderfully soft and can be used both indoors and outdoors for upholstery, slip covers, accessories, and much more.
