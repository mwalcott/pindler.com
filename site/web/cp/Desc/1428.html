1428-Mohair Plush is a 100% Mohair faced solid velvet.    Mohair Plush is classic and timeless, and can be used in all room settings whether contemporary or traditional.  Our Mohair Plush is soft to the touch while remarkably naturally resilient and durable.  Mohair is a natural fiber spun from the fine, lustrous hair of the Angora goat, one of the oldest animals known to man.  Mohair is two and a half times as strong as wool and outwears it.  Mohair has a natural luster that captures light and dye colors achieving deep and richly complex colorations.
