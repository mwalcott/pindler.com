5507-Eleganza is an Exclusive Hearst Castle&trade; design inspired by the chairs and sofa in William Randolph Hearst&#146;s private enclave, the 3rd floor Gothic library. Every day, he would retreat to this room with copies of Hearst newspaper flown in from distant cities. Our interpretation of Eleganza is an exquisite and intricately embroidered floral pattern on a linen ground with metallic embroidery thread, and cord applique known as &quot;couching&quot;.
