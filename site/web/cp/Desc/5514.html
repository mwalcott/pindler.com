5514-Ferriera is an Exclusive Hearst Castle&trade; design inspired by an intricately embroidered 18th century Spanish wall hanging, found in the bedroom of Casa Del Mar. Hearst used Casa Del Mar as his personal residence during the construction of the Castle. Our interpretation is a textural adaptation woven in a blend of cotton, linen, and wool.
