1872-Easton is a Signature Exclusive Newport Mansions Indoor/Outdoor upholstery design. Easton was inspired by a circa 1900 batik sarong from Java that was found in the textile archives of The Preservation Society of Newport County.  Shades of indigo blue undulate with batik floral garlands and vertical bands known as &quot;dlorong&quot;. The hand-drawn wax resist technique of picotage creates small dots on the background, and is typical of the region of Java.  Easton is woven with Sunbrella 100% solution dyed all-weather acrylic yarns.  Our Sunbrella collection captures the casual, yet lavish lifestyle of summering in Newport, which is considered one of the most historic areas in American history.
