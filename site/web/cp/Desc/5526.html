5526-Polaris is an Exclusive Hearst Castle&trade; design inspired by the 15th century Spanish ceiling in the north bedroom in Casa Grande&#146;s Gothic Suite. This ceiling has geometric shapes showing the Moorish influence in Southern Spain. Our interpretation of Polaris is a modernized version of the classic geometric that has been simplified and woven in an interesting and textured linen semi sheer drapery.
