5509-Portiere is an Exclusive Hearst Castle&trade; design inspired by a bedcover found in the bedroom of the guest house, Casa Del Monte. This was William Randolph Hearst&#146;s bedroom where he stayed for many years during construction of the Castle. Our interpretation of Portiere is a classic framed damask pattern embroidered on a linen ground, using tonal colors.
