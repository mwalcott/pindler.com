4719-Clint is an Exclusive upholstery ethnic stripe. Clint is a bold Southwest border stripe pattern inspired by a vintage horse blanket with the iconic design element centered down the middle for a striking focal point.  Clint is woven with texture yarns, including flax, and rustic weave structures that give an antiqued look to the fabric. This collection is an authentic Southwestern grouping that gets its inspiration from classic design icons of the American Indian culture. Known for their use of simple geometry of symbolic design, much of their textiles incorporated the art of balance within nature.
