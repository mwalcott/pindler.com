T186-Waterfield is a wonderful bead tassel fringe. Waterfield is made up of a grosgrain texture header accented with pinstripes and chenille and lustrous accents across the header creating an interesting pattern.  Hanging from the header are round beads hung at alternating heights and accented with clear mini beads.  Waterfield is an elegant trim that beautifully enhances bedding, draperies, upholstery, and accessories.
