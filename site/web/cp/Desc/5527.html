5527-Giarrita is an Exclusive Hearst Castle&trad3; design inspired inspired by two small 16th century Florentine chairs, located in the hallway lobby leading to the sitting room in Casa del Mar. Our interpretation has taken the classic damask pattern on the chair and expanded the layout, giving more ground around the figure. Giarrita is a dramatic linen drapery damask woven with two tone colors to create a subtle yet striking effect.
