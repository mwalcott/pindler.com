1055-Solana is an Exclusive Hearst Castle Indoor/Outdoor midscale pattern.  Solana was inspired by a 19th century Moorish decorative keyhole arch made with hand-painted tastir tiles found in the Hearst Castle.  A keyhole arch shape is found quite frequently in Moorish and Moroccan architecture, as it was believed to ward off the evil eye.   Solana is a beautiful all over pattern that features medallions and diamonds of filigree with accenting centers for a multicolor effect.  Solana is woven with texture and dimension and has been washed to enhance the hand of the fabric.  Solana has been woven with Sunbrella 100% solution dyed all-weather acrylic yarns.
