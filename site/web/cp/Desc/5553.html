5553-Hermoso is an Exclusive Hearst Castle&trade design inspired by an ornamental box found in the library at Hearst Castle. Our interpretation of Hermoso is a subtle all-over design that is quietly elegant. Woven with two types of chenille, the figures raise off of the surface for a dimensional effect. Hermoso can function as a sophisticated plain due to the subtle colorations.
