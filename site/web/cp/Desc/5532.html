5532-Armorial is an Exclusive Hearst Castle&trade; design inspired by an original tile rendering by Hearst&#146;s architect and designer, Julia Morgan. Julia Morgan was the first woman architect to receive a certificate in architecture from the prestigious Ecole of Paris. Julia worked side by side with William Randolph Hearst on every detail for twenty-eight years. We have interpreted this drawing to create Armorial, a lustrous velvet jacquard that has the detail and shading of the original drawing.
