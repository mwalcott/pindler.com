4708-Dragonfly is an Exclusive Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor midscale transitional dragonfly pattern.  Dragonfly was inspired by a circa 1900 Japanese kimono, found in the textile archives of Doris Duke.  In Japan, the dragonfly design is considered a Kachi-mushi (victory insect), bringing good luck. Our version of Dragonfly has an authentic kimono look to it.  The Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor Collection is an eclectic assortment of exotic patterns inspired by the batiks, sarongs, kimonos, and personal gatherings of an iconic world traveler, Doris Duke. We have incorporated different weaves and structures to emulate the documents, adding touches of chenille, shading, and texture to make the fabrics that much more interesting.  Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor is wonderfully soft and can be used both indoors and outdoors for upholstery, slip covers, accessories, and much more.
