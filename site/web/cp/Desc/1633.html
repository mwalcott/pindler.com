1633-Kennedy is a multipurpose embroidered linen design. Kennedy is a modern undulating wave design embroidered with long, flat stitching for a satin look to the embroidery yarns, and accented with a rice stitch on top of the satin stitching.  This lustrous embroidery technique is offset by a dry linen and cotton blend ground for an interesting play of surface dimension and texture.
