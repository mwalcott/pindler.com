4730-Bradbury is a multipurpose brushed cotton solid from Italy.  Bradbury is a great basic 100% cotton cloth that has been brushed with a stonewashed look to enhance the look and feel of the fabric.  Bradbury is reminiscent of your most comfortable worn in jeans, or an heirloom linen passed down from generation to generation.  This fabric is given a lot of character in the finish and post weaving process, and is woven in Italy.
