4777-Araldica is an Exclusive Hearst Castle multipurpose linen embroidery.  Araldica was inspired by an exquisite 18th century Spanish appliqued portiere, a decorative drape that is placed over a doorway entry. This document was found in the archive vault at Hearst Castle.  Our interpretation is an intricately embroidered classic damask design given dimension by the use of an appliqued cording technique, embroidered onto a beautiful linen blend ground cloth. The Hearst Castle Collection is a gorgeous assortment of fabrics that reflect the grandeur, luxury, wonder and mystique of this famous castle in California which tells the story of Hearst&#146;s passion for all things beautiful.
