1888-Douppioni is a 100% silk solid.  Douppioni yarns have a refined, subtle slub quality that is desirable in the design trade. Douppioni (meaning double) silk is produced when two silkworms spin their cocoons together into one. When the silk is unreeled from the cocoon it produces a silk thread that is thick and thin at random intervals. When woven the douppioni silk yarns create and elegant surface texture with visual interest.
