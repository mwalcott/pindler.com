4711-Tangalla is an Exclusive Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade Indoor/Outdoor small scale chenille diamond.  Tangalla was inspired by an indigo block print found in the archives of Doris Duke.  Hand carved wooden blocks were used to print wax for the indigo resist dye.  Our version of Tangalla is a woven with two colors of chenille in the figure against a flat background.  Tangalla almost appears as a cut velvet, with the figure raising off of the ground&#146;s surface.  The Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade Indoor/Outdoor Collection is an eclectic assortment of exotic patterns inspired by the batiks, sarongs, kimonos, and personal gatherings of an iconic world traveler, Doris Duke.  We have incorporated different weaves and structures to emulate the documents, adding touches of chenille, shading, and texture to make the fabrics that much more interesting.  Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade Indoor/Outdoor is wonderfully soft and can be used both indoors and outdoors for upholstery, slip covers, accessories, and much more.
