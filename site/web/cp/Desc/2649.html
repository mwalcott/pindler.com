2649-Boulevard is a Signature Exclusive Hearst Castle Sunbrella Indoor/Outdoor stripe.  Boulevard was inspired by the colorful flags hanging in the Hearst Castle dining room.  The flags represent the families from the town of Sienna, Italy and are hung during the Palio Della Contrada, a horse race that is run twice a year.  Our version of Boulevard is woven with Sunbrella 100% solution dyed all-weather acrylic yarns.  The heavy weave structure utilizes a full face satin weave for maximum depth and purity of color.  This exquisite collection combines the timeless elegance and lavishness of the Castle with the functionality and durability of Sunbrella Indoor/Outdoor yarns.
