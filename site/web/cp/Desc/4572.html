4572-Trianon is a strie upholstery velvet engineered to achieve an elegant soft variegated strie. Trianon is strategically woven with a combination of mercerized cotton and combed cotton and dyed with a proprietary dye differential technique. This technique disperses the dyes differently to the mercerized and combed cotton to achieve the subtle strie of color.
