5559-Intaglio is an Exclusive Hearst Castle&trade; upholstery design inspired by the 15th century Spanish balconies affixed to the towers on &quot;C&quot; guest house. The inspired geometric elements were originally Moorish or mashrabiyas screens acquired by Hearst in 1923, and modified as balconies. Our version is an epingle cut velvet forming the classic Moorish design element.
