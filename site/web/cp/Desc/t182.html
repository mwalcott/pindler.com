T182-Ashdale is a crocheted gimp tape.  Ashdale is a grosgrain ribbon accented with a loop scallop on either side of the tape, forming an ogee shape along the trim.  Accenting the trim is a chenille novelty yarn down the center, and lustrous yarns at the joins of the scallops.  Ashdale is used for edging pillows, upholstery, accessories, and drapery.
