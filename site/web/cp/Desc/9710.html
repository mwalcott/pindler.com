9710-Kashmir is a Signature Exclusive Newport Mansions Doris Duke multipurpose crewel design. Kashmir was inspired by a late 17th century crewelwork, embroidered with wool on a silk linen ground. This fine example of crewelwork hangs as a pair of draperies in the corridor at Doris Duke&#146;s Estate.  Kashmir,India is the only providence to produce these crewels, and has been doing so for centuries.  We have commissioned this fabulous pattern to replicate the work and design of the original document. Kashmir is embroidered using 100% 2 ply wool embroidery yarn on a 100% cotton dosutti ground cloth.
