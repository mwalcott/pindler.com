3836-Orleans is a Signature Exclusive Sunbrella indoor/outdoor pattern. Orleans is a classic mid scale all over circle pattern woven with performance Sunbrella 100% solution dyed all-weather acrylic yarns. This pattern has weave texture irregularities that were intentionally designed into the fabric that add a hand-woven, vintage appearance to it.  Richard Frinier created these understated patterns to work for a variety of applications to evoke the romantic elegance of Provençe.
