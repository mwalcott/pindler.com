5511-Milagro is an Exclusive Hearst Castle&trade; design inspired by a 19th century silk damask, originally upholstered on a lady&#146;s stepping stool. This fabric was later removed and preserved in the Hearst Castle archives. Our interpretation of Milagro is an exquisite, bold, and timeless multipurpose embroidery on a natural linen ground. Milagro is an elegant design with an iconic motif that is classic and stately, but also romantic and soft.
