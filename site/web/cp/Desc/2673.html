2673-Nairobi is a Signature Exclusive upholstery ethnic chenille washed damask design. Nairobi is a midscale chenille zebra skin pattern that emulates a cut velvet, given dimension by the contrast of a textural background against a raised chenille figure.  Woven in a rayon, polyester, cotton, and flax blend, Nairobi is a perfect fabric to bring in a bit of pattern, color, and luxurious texture.
