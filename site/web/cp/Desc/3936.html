3936-Zambia is a Signature Exclusive upholstery ethnic washed chenille damask. Zambia is a washed chenille zebra skin pattern that emulates a cut velvet, given dimension by the contrast of a textural background against a raised chenille figure.  Woven in rayon, Zambia is a perfect fabric to bring in a bit of pattern, color, and luxurious texture to a room setting.
