3461-Breckenridge is a Signature Exclusive drapery casement. Breckenridge is a gorgeous yet subtle plaid casement that blends matte natural linen yarns with highly lustrous rayon shoelace yarns for a dramatic contrast in texture.  In the warp, a cotton lino warp is used in two different spacings: bands of warp set with 1 cm spacings are alternated with bands of warp with .5 cm spacings.
