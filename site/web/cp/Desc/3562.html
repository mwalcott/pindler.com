3562-Stonington is a Signature Exclusive upholstery solid design. Stonington is a wonderfully textural herringbone that has been woven on a boucle warp with a novelty twist yarn in the fill.  Woven in a rayon, cotton, linen, and polyester blend, Stonington has a very elegant and stately surface texture and dimension and comes with a Teflon finish.
