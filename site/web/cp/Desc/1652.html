1652-Ninove is a drapery linen solid design. This is a simple, beautiful canvas weave solid design with 100% pure and natural linen grown in Belgium from the flax plant. Flax has been grown for thousands of years, as it is gentle on the land and is grown with very little chemicals.  No irrigation is needed to grow flax, and flax is easy to incorporate into modern crop rotation cycles.  The processing of flax needs very little energy, which does not harm the environment.  The Eco Friendly Natural Linen Book was designed for the discerning customer who is making the choice to be environmentally responsible without having to sacrifice style.
