2648-Mudejar is a Signature Exclusive Hearst Castle Sunbrella Indoor/Outdoor pattern.  Mudejar was inspired by tiles found in the archives of Hearst Castle.  These tiles were originally from Spain dating back to 16th century Mudejar. The Mudejar style came about when Moorish influences mingled with Western influence to create repetitive design elements.  Our version of Mudejar is woven with Sunbrella 100% solution dyed all-weather acrylic yarns.  This exquisite collection combines the timeless elegance and lavishness of the Castle with the functionality and durability of Sunbrella&reg; Indoor/Outdoor yarns.
