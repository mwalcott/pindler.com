2199-Jamil is a Signature Exclusive multipurpose linen embroidery design. Jamil is a modern geometric embroidery that emulates elements from a Kuba cloth, in an allover, almost three dimensional sort of way.  Done in a tonal, very neutral palette, Jamil is a natural yet unexpected and modern approach to contemporary luxe.
