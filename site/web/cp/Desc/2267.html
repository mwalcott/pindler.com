2267-Serape is an upholstery solid design. Serape is a wonderfully textural solid that emulates a Serape cloth, and is woven in a rayon and polyester blend.  Serape is woven on a strie warp and has different colors and yarn deniers within the pattern, creating a fabulously textural surface dimension.
