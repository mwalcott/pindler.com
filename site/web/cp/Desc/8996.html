8996-Escalera is a Signature Exclusive Hearst Castle Indoor/Outdoor design.  Escalera was inspired by Cuenca tiles used in a terrace stairway leading to Casa Grande.  The use of ceramic tiles on the interior and exterior was an important feature in the Hearst Castle&#146;s Mediterranean Revival style of architecture. Escalera is woven with intricate weave details and chenille accents. Escalera has been woven with Sunbrella 100% solution dyed all-weather acrylic yarns.
