5560-Vargueno is an Exclusive Hearst Castle&trade; design adapted from a 16th Century Spanish cabinet housed in the Billiard Room. The cabinet was overlaid with a pierced iron decorative grid motif which we rendered into an overall repeat then woven as an epingle cut velvet. Vargueno is a lustrous and elegant gridwork pattern that features rayon cut velvet in the figure against an epingle ground for a dimensional effect.
