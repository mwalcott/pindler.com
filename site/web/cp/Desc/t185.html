T185-Derbyshire is a beautiful tassel fringe. Derbyshire has a header that is made up of a multicolor grosgrain tape, accented with a loop scallop at the top, and a chenille novelty yarn accenting the center of the trim.   Hanging from the header are tassels that have been hand tied with a novelty yarn. Derbyshire is an elegant, understated trim that enhances bedding, draperies, upholstery, and accessories.
