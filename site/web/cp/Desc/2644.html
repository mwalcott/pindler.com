2644-Alameda is a Signature Exclusive Hearst Castle Sunbrella Indoor/Outdoor stripe.  Alameda was inspired by one of the original saddle blankets found in the archives of Hearst Castle, well used, to saddle up in William Randolph Hearst&#146;s horse stable.  This blanket was hand woven by tribal Indians from hand spun wool yarn is a classic example of a simple stripe saddle blanket.

The heavy weave structure utilizes a full face rep weave to emulate the original hand-loomed look. This exquisite collection combines the timeless elegance and lavishness of the Castle with the functionality and durability of Sunbrella&reg; Indoor/Outdoor yarns.
