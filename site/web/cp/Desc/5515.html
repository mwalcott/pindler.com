5515-Ithaca is an Exclusive Hearst Castle&trade; design inspired by the border of an early craftsman hooked rug found in the archives of Hearst Castle. Our interpretation of Ithaca was to stylize the border into a classic Greek key, woven as an epingle cut velvet on a sateen ground. The edges of each figure are lined with a row of epingle, with the cut velvet pile in the center, accentuating the dimension of the pile and epingle.
