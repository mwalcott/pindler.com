5533-Venetian is an Exclusive Hearst Castle&trade; design inspired by the 17th century Italian silk velvet &quot;Dante&quot; chairs, which flank both sides of the famed dining table in the Refectory where celebrated quests dined with Hearst long ago. Our interpretation of the original Italian silk velvet, known as the Velvet to the Doges, has been adapted by an Italian velvet mill by use of permanent embossing, creating a three dimensional pattern.
