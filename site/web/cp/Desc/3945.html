3945-Afton is a drapery flame resistant solid.  Afton is a classic semi sheer solid that is woven with slubs in the warp and weft, as well as space dyed yarns for added variegation.  Afton is woven in a polyester that is inherently flame resistant and meets 701 Small Scale for FR. . It is inspired from silk dyeing methods used hundreds of years ago in India when producing natural tussah silk.  The heavy slub texture in the yarns is reminiscent of traditional handspun, hand dyed fibers, which absorb color vibrantly.
