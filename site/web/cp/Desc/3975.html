3975-Bandari is a Signature Exclusive upholstery stripe.  Bandari is an etchy stripe pattern that features several colors of textural novelty mini shoelace yarns, but flat and lustrous, giving a play of surface dimension to the face of the fabric.  Woven in a viscose rayon, made in America using the finest yarns and fibers, this is a fabulous grouping of luxurious upholstery designs colored in sophisticated, modern metal neutrals accented with trend pop colors.
