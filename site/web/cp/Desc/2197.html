2197-Jaipur is a Signature Exclusive multipurpose silk embroidery design. Jaipur is a modern geometric embroidery that emulates elements from a Kuba cloth, in an allover, almost three dimensional sort of way.  Done in a tonal, very neutral palette, Jaipur is a richly decadent yet unexpected and modern approach to contemporary luxe.
