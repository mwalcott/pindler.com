4705-Balinese is an Exclusive Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor midscale ethnic batik pattern.  Balinese was inspired by a circa 1900 Indonesian batik found in the textile archives of Doris Duke.  Kawung is one of the oldest batik motifs, a stylized four lobed flower with a repeating circular design.  Our version of Balinese has a hand drawn look to it.  We have kept the original spirit of the design by engineering the original background texture into the fabric.  The Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor Collection is an eclectic assortment of exotic patterns inspired by the batiks, sarongs, kimonos, and personal gatherings of an iconic world traveler, Doris Duke.  We have incorporated different weaves and structures to emulate the documents, adding touches of chenille, shading, and texture to make the fabrics that much more interesting.  Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor is wonderfully soft and can be used both indoors and outdoors for upholstery, slip covers, accessories, and much more.
