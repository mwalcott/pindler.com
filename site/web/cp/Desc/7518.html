7518-Uccello is a signature exclusive Hearst pattern adapated from an 18th century Italian silk wall hanging that is embroidered with flowers, birds and a central hunting scene that is located in Casa del Mar Hero Room.  We have isolated design elements from the original document to retain and capture the amazing detail and whimsical charm of the checkered birds and ribbons.  Our damask upholstery is woven on an Egyptian cotton warp with a 325 thread count and is packed with tissue yarns to emulate embroidery.  Texture is added with slubbed ottoman ground.   (Uccello is Italian for bird)
