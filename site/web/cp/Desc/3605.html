3605-Sumi is a Signature Exclusive upholstery ethnic tapestry design.  Sumi is a gorgeous pattern that was inspired by centuries-old ikat weaving techniques.  We have seen a big interest in ikats in the design world, and this one was inspired by an antique silk ikat that was handknotted and resist dyed in Uzbekistan.  Sumi is a pattern that can go in a classic world traveler setting or a modern one depending on its use and surroundings.  Sumi is tapestry woven in a rayon, polyester and nylon blend with boucle in the ground accented by color in the figure.
