2645-Pastiglia is a Signature Exclusive Hearst Castle Sunbrella Indoor/Outdoor pattern.  Pastiglia was inspired by an original drawing by Julia Morgan, Hearst&#146;s architect and designer.  Julia Morgan, the first woman architect to receive a certificate in architecture graduated from the prestigious Ecole of Paris.  Julia Morgan worked side by side with William Randolph Hearst on every detail of the castle for 28 years.  This drawing, depicting an architectural detail is known as a pastiglia, was given for the craftsmen to follow.  Our version of Pastiglia is a beautiful medallion design with a raised surface weave and attention to detail.  Woven with performance Sunbrella 100% solution dyed all-weather acrylic yarns, Pastiglia is classic and elegant, as well as usable for indoor and outdoor use.  This exquisite collection combines the timeless elegance and lavishness of the Castle with the functionality and durability of Sunbrella Indoor/Outdoor yarns.
