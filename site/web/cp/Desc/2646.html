2646-Kuna is a Signature Exclusive Hearst Castle Sunbrella Indoor/Outdoor pattern.  Kuna was inspired by one of many molas found in the archives of Hearst Castle.  On one of William Randolph Hearst&#146;s sailing trips, he sailed his ship, the Oneida, through the Panama Canal.  The Kuna Indians from the San Blas Islands of Panama create this rich and colorful textile art utilizing a reverse appliqué technique.  No two molas are alike.  They are used as story telling or symbols of daily life, worn by the Kuna Indian women as a part of their cultural dress.  Our version of Kuna is woven with Sunbrella 100% solution dyed all-weather acrylic yarns.  This exquisite collection combines the timeless elegance and lavishness of the Castle with the functionality and durability of Sunbrella&reg; Indoor/Outdoor yarns.
