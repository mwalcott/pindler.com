1653-Haley is a drapery sheer embroidered design. Haley is a modern undulating wave design embroidered with long, flat stitching for a satin look to the embroidery yarns, and accented with a rice stitch on top of the satin stitching.  This lustrous embroidery technique is offset by a dry cotton organdy sheer ground for an interesting play of surface dimension and texture.
