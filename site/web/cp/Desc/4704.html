4704-Sashiko is an Exclusive Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor midscale ethnic hand drawn pattern.  Sashiko was inspired by a Japanese Haori kimono from the early Meiji period, found in the textile archives of Doris Duke.  Sashiko (literally &quot;little stabs&quot;) is an ancient form of embroidery stitching onto a cloth dyed in indigo blue. Our version of Sashiko is a great midscale pattern that emulates the original document.  We have purposely made the design slightly irregular for a hand drawn, handmade look for a more authentic feel.  The Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor Collection is an eclectic assortment of exotic patterns inspired by the batiks, sarongs, kimonos, and personal gatherings of an iconic world traveler, Doris Duke.  We have incorporated different weaves and structures to emulate the documents, adding touches of chenille, shading, and texture to make the fabrics that much more interesting.  Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor is wonderfully soft and can be used both indoors and outdoors for upholstery, slip covers, accessories, and much more.
