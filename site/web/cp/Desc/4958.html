4958-Tularosa is an Exclusive upholstery large scale ethnic pattern.  Tularosa is a classic Southwest diamond design in a rustic, natural looking construction with a bit of flax in it.  Tularosa emulates hand woven horse blankets and Southwest carpets with the use of heavier novelty texture yarns and classic colorways.  Tularosa works in today&#146;s modern lodge looks, classic mountain cabins, or as a decorative Southwest accent to any room scene.
