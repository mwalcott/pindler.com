3922-Iberia is a Signature Exclusive Hearst Castle design inspired by a 4th century BC Iberian clay vase acquired by William Randolph Hearst at auction in Spain.  The vase is painted in a geometric pattern with raised relief and clay stain.  The original colors of the vase were most likely vibrant.  The sun, the moon, water, and fire were their gods.  Our version has an interesting constrast of surface texture using a natural 100% linen background with a silk/viscose blend applique forming the figure.  A top stitch edges the figure for added dimension and a finished look.  This collection is a gorgeous assortment of fabrics that reflect the grandeur, luxury, wonder and mystique of this famous castle in California which tells the story of Hearst&#146;s passion for all things beautiful.
