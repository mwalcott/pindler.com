Sequoia is a classic pattern and design element that has been simplified and softened down with a subtle and sophisticated palette and has been washed for extra softness and quality of hand.  This collection is an authentic Southwestern grouping that gets its inspiration from classic design icons of the American Indian culture. Known for their use of simple geometry of symbolic design, much of their textiles incorporated the art of balance within nature.
