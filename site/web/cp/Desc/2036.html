2036-Kundalini is a Signature Exclusive Hearst Castle upholstery washed damask.  Kundalini was inspired by an antique hand-dyed, handwoven Uzbeki adras panel found in the preservation vaults at the Hearst Castle. This bright ikat adras was woven in the Fergana Valley region of Uzbekistan. Ikat is a technique of weaving that requires a great amount of precision of tying and dyeing warp yarns in order to achieve the pattern. Our version of this design is a more luxurious approach to this exotic and interesting design. Kundalini is woven in a fabulous damask construction that features chenille, boucle, and strie rayon yarns that form an ombree effect throughout the design. Kundalini is washed to enhance the look of the fabric and to soften the hand.
