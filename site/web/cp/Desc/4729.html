4729-Fairmont is a multipurpose brushed cotton and linen blend solid from Italy.  Fairmont is a stonewashed solid that has been brushed to enhance the look and feel of the fabric.  Fairmont is reminiscent of your most comfortable worn in jeans, or an heirloom linen passed down from generation to generation.  This fabric is given a lot of character in the finish and post weaving process, and is woven in Italy.
