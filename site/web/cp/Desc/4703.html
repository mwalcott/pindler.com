4703-Shibori is an Exclusive Newport Mansions Doris Duke&#0153; Indoor/Outdoor large scale ethnic stripe.  Shibori was inspired by a Japanese Nui Shibori from the late Meiji period (1900) found in the archives of Doris Duke.  Mui Shibori is a stitching technique that is pulled tight to create an indigo resist-dyed fabric. Our version of Shibori is an eclectic stripe that nicely emulates the handmade variances of the original document.  Since each dot of the stripe was created uniquely, they are each slightly different.  We made sure to keep the spirit of this irregularity alive in the interpretation for an authentic look.  The Newport Mansions Doris Duke&#0153; Indoor/Outdoor Collection is an eclectic assortment of exotic patterns inspired by the batiks, sarongs, kimonos, and personal gatherings of an iconic world traveler, Doris Duke.  We have incorporated different weaves and structures to emulate the documents, adding touches of chenille, shading, and texture to make the fabrics that much more interesting.  Newport Mansions Doris Duke&#0153; Indoor/Outdoor is wonderfully soft and can be used both indoors and outdoors for upholstery, slip covers, accessories, and much more.
