5508-Splendore is an Exclusive Hearst Castle&trade; design inspired by the silk jacquard damask used as a wall covering in the sitting room in &quot;C&quot; house. This room shows Hearst&#146;s interest in Spanish influences. Our interpretation of Splendore is simplified, focusing on one elegant element, beautifully embroidered on a linen ground.
