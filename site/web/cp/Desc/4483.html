4483-Izmir is a multipurpose novelty.  Izmir is made with recycled sari strips that have been twisted and handloomed in the weft for an interesting surface texure and dimension.  A sari is a strip of unstitched cloth, worn by women, ranging from four to nine yards in length that is draped over the body in various styles which is native to the Indian Subcontinent. They are often bright in color, and can be matte or lustrous.  Retired saris have been upcycled in three of these fabrics for a bright play of different colors, luster levels, and thicknesses.  Every yard woven is unique and will vary in color and texture.  These variations are what gives these fabrics their individual charm.
