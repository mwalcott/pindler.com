7515-Draconis is a signature exclusive Hearst design inspired by a silk damask fabric found on six club chairs and a sofa circa 1930s-40s located in the Assembly Room.   Our traditionally styled framed damask includes mythological griffons and birds presented with a subtle puckered texture and luxurious drapability gained in the washing process.  (Draconis is Latin for Dragon)
