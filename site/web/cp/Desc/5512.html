5512-Paramento is an Exclusive Hearst Castle&trade; design inspired by a silk damask document preserved in the archives of the Hearst Castle, previously used as wall upholstery.  Paramento is a damask that is timeless.  Our interpretation of Paramento is woven with an Egyptian mercerized cotton ground with the figure woven in lustrous yarns for a faux silk effect.
