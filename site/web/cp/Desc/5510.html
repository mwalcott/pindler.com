5510-Ornatezza is an Exclusive Hearst Castle&#146; design inspired by a 17th century Spanish polychrome gilt woodcarving of a figure of a Saint acquired in 1926, located in the North Wing second floor bedroom in Hearst Castle. Our interpretation is an appliqued velvet embroidered onto a linen ground to achieve an elegant, modern, and classic icon.
