4722-Colton is an Exclusive upholstery ethnic stripe.  Colton is a traditional textural Southwest stripe that was inspired by a vintage serape.  Colton is woven with weave structures and pattern including herringbone, twill and checkerboard to add texture and dimension to the fabric.  This collection is an authentic Southwestern grouping that gets its inspiration from classic design icons of the American Indian culture. Known for their use of simple geometry of symbolic design, much of their textiles incorporated the art of balance within nature.
