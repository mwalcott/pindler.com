5558-Keystone is an Exclusive upholstery midscale design. Keystone is a traditional ethnic geometric design, with rug-like texture. This collection is an authentic Western grouping that draws inspiration from classic design icons of Native American culture. Known for their use of simple geometry of symbolic design, much of their textiles incorporated the art of balance within nature.  The patterns in the Mountain Lodge Collection are exclusive to Pindler and have been colored in an updated Southwestern color palette.
