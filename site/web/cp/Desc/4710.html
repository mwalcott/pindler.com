4710-Mali is an Exclusive Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor midscale ikat chevron.  Mali was inspired by a circa 1900 ikat fabric, made with indigo dyes, found in the textile archives of Doris Duke.  Ikat is a Malaysian word meaning &quot;to tie&quot;. Loose bundles of yarns are tied tightly and dipped into indigo vats, to create a resist dye. Areas tied remain white, while untied dyed indigo. These yarns are then used to weave the ikat design. Our version of Mali is an eclectic and transitional ikat chevron that woven with textural interest.  The Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor Collection is an eclectic assortment of exotic patterns inspired by the batiks, sarongs, kimonos, and personal gatherings of an iconic world traveler, Doris Duke.  We have incorporated different weaves and structures to emulate the documents, adding touches of chenille, shading, and texture to make the fabrics that much more interesting.  Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor is wonderfully soft and can be used both indoors and outdoors for upholstery, slip covers, accessories, and much more.
