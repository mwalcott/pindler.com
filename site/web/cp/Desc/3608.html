3608-Warner is a Signature Exclusive upholstery solid. Warner is a gorgeous and tonal textural herringbone pattern that has a beautiful play of texture and surface dimension.  The lustrous rayon yarns against the matte twisted cotton creates highs and lows on the surface of the fabric.  Warner is an elegant version of the menswear suiting trend we have seen in the design community, and is suitable for a wide variety of looks and applications.
