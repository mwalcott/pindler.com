3687-Magnifique is a Signature Exclusive Newport Mansions&trade; Doris Duke design.  This design was inspired by a gilded Italian tooled leather from the 18th century, preserved in the textile archives at Doris Duke&#146;s Newport Estate, Rough Point.  This exquisite piece has a burnished finish and was once applied to a high back chair and has since been removed for preservation.  Our interpretation was to use embroidery to emulate the raised surface and capture the intricate detail of the original document.  These collections are a fantastic assortment of fabrics that reflect the timeless beauty and lavish elegance that the Newport Mansions&trade; has come to represent.
