9000-Armadietto is a Signature Exclusive Hearst Castle Indoor/Outdoor design.  Armadietto was adapted from a 16th Century Spanish cabinet housed in the Billiard Room.  The cabinet was overlaid with a pierced iron decorative grid motif that has been rendered into a repeat and woven with a soft boucle yarn to add texture and dimension.  Armadietto has been woven with Sunbrella 100% solution dyed all-weather acrylic yarns, making it suitable for indoor and outdoor use.
