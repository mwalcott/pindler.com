2647-Mola is a Signature Exclusive Hearst Castle Sunbrella Indoor/Outdoor pattern.  Mola was inspired by one of many molas found in the archives of Hearst Castle.  On one of William Randolph Hearst&#146;s sailing trips, he sailed his ship, the Oneida, through the Panama Canal.  The Kuna Indians from the San Blas Islands of Panama create this rich and colorful textile art utilizing a reverse applique technique. This mola design reflects the influences of the modern world with the traditional Kuna culture.   Some mola designs are inspired by graphics seen on political posters, labels, advertisements, etc, incorporated into the traditional themes from Kuna legends and culture.  Our version of Mola is woven with Sunbrella 100% solution dyed all-weather acrylic yarns. This exquisite collection combines the timeless elegance and lavishness of the Castle with the functionality and durability of Sunbrella Indoor/Outdoor yarns.
