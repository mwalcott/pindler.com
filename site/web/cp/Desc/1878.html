1878-Coggeshall is a Signature Exclusive Newport Mansions Indoor/Outdoor upholstery design.  Coggeshall was inspired by a traditional Pasisir batik cloth found in the archives of The Preservation Society of Newport County.  The &quot;cocohan&quot; technique of small dots in the ground, which is exclusive to Indramayu Java, has been carefully captured in our exclusive design.  Coggeshall has been woven with Sunbrella 100% solution dyed all-weather acrylic yarns. Our Sunbrella collection captures the casual, yet lavish lifestyle of summering in Newport, which is considered one of the most historic areas in American history.
