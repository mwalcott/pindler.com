4778-Corinthian is an Exclusive Hearst Castle&trade; design inspired by a 16th century Italian chasuble found in the archive vault at Hearst Castle.  A chasuble is a liturgy vestment worn by clergy during sacred ceremonies.  They typically will include elaborate decorative embroidery and applique cording, such as this one.  Our interpretation is a gorgeous scrolling foliage embroidery design on a linen ground, with the pattern cascading down the fabric vertically.  The fabric is then appliqued with a cording, outlining the pattern and creating dimension.
