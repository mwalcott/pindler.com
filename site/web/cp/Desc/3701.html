3701-Bella Vite is a Signature Exclusive Newport Mansions Doris Duke design.  This design was inspired by an 18th century crewel embroidery found in the textile archives at Doris Duke&#146;s Newport Estate, Rough Point.  The document was originally applied to a settee, and later removed to preserve it in the archives.  The original piece was embroidered with wool using French knots, and a couching technique.  Our interpretation is using a linen ground with cotton embroidery.  These collections are a fantastic assortment of fabrics that reflect the timeless beauty and lavish elegance that the Newport Mansions&trade; has come to represent.
