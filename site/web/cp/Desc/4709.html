4709-Tamil is an Exclusive Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor small scale block print pattern.  Tamil was inspired by an Indian batik cloth found in the textile archives of Doris Duke. This batik was created by using a wax resist method, hand stamping a copper block motif with wax, and then dipping into the indigo dye vat. Our version of Tamil has a hand block print look to it. The Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor Collection is an eclectic assortment of exotic patterns inspired by the batiks, sarongs, kimonos, and personal gatherings of an iconic world traveler, Doris Duke. We have incorporated different weaves and structures to emulate the documents, adding touches of chenille, shading, and texture to make the fabrics that much more interesting.  Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade Indoor/Outdoor is wonderfully soft and can be used both indoors and outdoors for upholstery, slip covers, accessories, and much more.
