3502-Becket is a Signature Exclusive upholstery ethnic stripe design.  Becket is a wonderful textural stripe inspired by an American Indian handwoven blanket.  Becket is a fabulous combination of a traditional rustic lodge look pattern but woven in a lustrous, luxurious texture that has a great hand and look.  Becket is woven with two chenilles, two boucles, and novelty yarns that each come up in different areas for variety in surface texture and dimension.  Becket is woven in a rayon, cotton, polyester and nylon blend and is treated with a soil and stain resistant finish.
