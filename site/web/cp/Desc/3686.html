3686-Esotico is a Signature Exclusive Hearst Castle&trade; design inspired by an 18th century intricately embroidered silk bedspread.  This exquisite artifact has since been moved to the Hearst Castle vaults for preservation.  Our interpretation is a beautifully rendered floral pattern, which has been embroidered on a luxurious viscose rayon and silk blend.  This collection is a gorgeous assortment of fabrics that reflect the grandeur, luxury, wonder and mystique of this famous castle in California which tells the story of Hearst&#146;s passion for all things beautiful.
