1636-Audrey is a drapery sheer embroidered design. Audrey is a modern take on a classic ogee shape design.  Two complimenting colors create undulating ogees with accents of color where the lines meet.   Audrey is a beautiful embroidery on  a dry cotton organdy sheer ground for an interesting play of surface dimension and texture.
