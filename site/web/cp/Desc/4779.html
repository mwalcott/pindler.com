4779-Fiorito is an Exclusive Hearst Castle&trade; multipurpose embroidery.  Fiorito was inspired by a turn of the century exquisitely embroidered Chinese silk bedspread, found in the archive vault at Hearst Castle.  Our interpretation is an intricate floral vine embroidery given dimension by the use of an appliqued cording technique, embroidered onto a lustrous cotton sateen ground. The Hearst Castle Collection is a gorgeous assortment of fabrics that reflect the grandeur, luxury, wonder and mystique of this famous castle in California which tells the story of Hearst&#146;s passion for all things beautiful.
