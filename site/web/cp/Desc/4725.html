4725-Brooks is an Exclusive upholstery solid.  Brooks is a classic textural solid that looks like a hand woven textile.  A touch of flax gives this fabric even more personality and dimension.  Brooks is a great addition to this group and coordinates with the patterns in this group. This collection is an authentic Southwestern grouping that gets its inspiration from classic design icons of the American Indian culture. Known for their use of simple geometry of symbolic design, much of their textiles incorporated the art of balance within nature.
