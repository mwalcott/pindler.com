4700-Mandalay is an Exclusive Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor large scale floral.  Mandalay was inspired by a circa 1900 batik sarong, from Indonesia, found in the textile archives of Doris Duke. The floral batik design on the sarong was hand drawn using a wax resist and indigo dye technique of picotage, typical of this region.  Our version of Mandalay is an exotic floral vine drawing that looks hand drawn and is woven with texture in the weaves for added interest. The Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor Collection is an eclectic assortment of exotic patterns inspired by the batiks, sarongs, kimonos, and personal gatherings of an iconic world traveler, Doris Duke. We have incorporated different weaves and structures to emulate the documents, adding touches of chenille, shading, and texture to make the fabrics that much more interesting.  Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor is wonderfully soft and can be used both indoors and outdoors for upholstery, slip covers, accessories, and much more.
