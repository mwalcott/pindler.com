3685-Florasion is a Signature Exclusive Newport Mansions&trade; design.  This design was inspired by a Chinese embroidered silk crepe piano shawl (circa 1850) from the costume collection of The Preservation Society of Newport County.  The shawl originally belonged to Mrs. George Barclay whose family summered at Kingscote.  Our interpretation is a gorgeous linen ground embroidered with tonal colors using a cotton embroidery yarn.  These collections are a fantastic assortment of fabrics that reflect the timeless beauty and lavish elegance that the Newport Mansions&trade; has come to represent.
