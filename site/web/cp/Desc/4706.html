4706-Tulis is an Exclusive Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor small scale ethnic batik pattern.  Tulis was inspired by a circa 1900 batik found in the textile archives of Doris Duke. Hand drawn batiks are known as tulis batiks. A canting tool holds the wax used to draw the pattern onto the fabric for the resist dye technique. Our version of Tulis has been designed to keep the original look and integrity of the document.  The Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor Collection is an eclectic assortment of exotic patterns inspired by the batiks, sarongs, kimonos, and personal gatherings of an iconic world traveler, Doris Duke.  We have incorporated different weaves and structures to emulate the documents, adding touches of chenille, shading, and texture to make the fabrics that much more interesting.  Newport Mansions Doris Duke&trade; Indoor/Outdoor is wonderfully soft and can be used both indoors and outdoors for upholstery, slip covers, accessories, and much more.
