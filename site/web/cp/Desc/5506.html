5506-Shantou is a drapery flame resistant solid.  Shantou is a classic drapery solid that is woven with space dyed yarns in the warp and weft.  Slubs in the weave help create a textural interest and dimension.  Shantou is woven in a polyester that is inherently flame resistant and meets 701 Small Scale for FR. It is inspired from silk dyeing methods used hundreds of years ago in India when producing natural tussah silk.  The heavy slub texture in the yarns is reminiscent of traditional handspun, hand dyed fibers, which absorb color vibrantly.
