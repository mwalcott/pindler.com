5516-Ricamo is an Exclusive Hearst Castle&trade; design inspired by a large ceramic &quot;coil pot&quot; vessel designed by Hearst&#146;s architect, Julia Morgan. Installed in the gardens of the Casa Del Sol guest house, the stylized decorative surface design was created by rolling clay into long ropes, and was adhered through several glazes. Our interpretation of the scrolling floral design is an appliqued cord onto a 100% linen ground.
