1795-Lillett is a Signature Exclusive drapery casement design.  Lillett is a beautiful textural solid  casement woven in a lustrous rayon and linen blend. Lillett features a lustrous rayon novelty shoelace yarn both in the warp and the weft, offset by slightly slubby linen yarns in both directions.  This modern, edgy pattern catches the light in an elegant way.
