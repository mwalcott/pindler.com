1953-Astor is a Signature Exclusive Newport Mansions multipurpose linen embroidery.  Astor was inspired by the center front panel of a circa 1891 Cuirass bodice found in the archives of the Preservation Society of Newport County.  Astor uses a linen ground with lustrous rayon embroidery in three classic, elegant colorations.
