3459-Monroe is a Signature Exclusive upholstery chenille stripe. Monroe is a beautifully textural upholstery horizontal stripe woven in 100% rayon that blends twisted yarns, lustrous novelty yarns, and luxurious chenille for an interesting play of surface dimension and texture.  Highs and lows are created with the use of different yarn textures and colors for a transitional look that can go either classic or modern depending on use.
