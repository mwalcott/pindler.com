2667-Gardengate is a Signature Exclusive Newport Mansions upholstery damask design.  Gardengate was inspired by a painted floorscreen designed by Ogden Codman in 1895 for the guest bedroom of the Breakers mansion in Newport, RI. Our interpretation implements the beautiful ogee fret design into drop repeats creating an interwoven classic repeat with distinction.
