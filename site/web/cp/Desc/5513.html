5513-Giardino is an Exclusive Hearst Castle&trade; design inspired by an upholstered chair found in William Randolph Hearst&#146;s bedroom, which was surprisingly modest. Our interpretation of Giardino was to deconstruct and eliminate details to present a modern transitional Jacobean, making a bold statement. Giardino is beautifully embroidered on a 100% linen ground.
