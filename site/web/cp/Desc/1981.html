1981-Surat is a drapery sheer FR design.  Surat is a beautiful design in 100% polyester that resembles a silk tussah drapery cloth. Surat is a new version of our existing pattern 2883-Sansilk, which has been a classic for us for a number of years. Sansilk only comes in 48&quot; widths, but Surat will be offered in 54&quot; widths.  Surat features a variegated texture with occasional slubs that gives it a natural look.
