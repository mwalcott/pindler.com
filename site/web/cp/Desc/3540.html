3540-Haddington is a multipurpose solid design.  Haddington is a classic cotton and linen blend solid in a plain weave.  Haddington is woven with unbleached linen yarns in the warp, which give the fabric a unique and natural texture and charm.  The cotton yarns contain &quot;motes&quot; which are intentional.  Motes are small flecks from the cotton seeds, left in the yarn to achieve a rustic look.
