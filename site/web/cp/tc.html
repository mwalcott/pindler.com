		<p class="termspara"><b>ACCEPTANCE OF ORDERS.</b> All orders placed by you are subject to acceptance 
		by Pindler &amp; Pindler, Inc. and our credit department. Each order placed 
		by you and accepted by us is a sale subject to these Terms and 
		Conditions and indicates your assent to these Terms and Conditions 
		unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing.</p>
		
		<p class="termspara"><b>MINIMUM ORDER. One yard.</b></p>

		<p class="termspara"><b>WHEN ORDERING.</b> Often much time can be saved and your order more 
		satisfactorily filled, if you will specify the end use for which the 
		fabric is intended; and if it is for draperies or curtains, you specify 
		the lengths needed.</p>
		
		<p class="termspara"><b>CORRELATED PRINTS.</b> Correlated prints are designed and colored so they 
		may be used successfully together as companion designs in color 
		correlated decorating plans. But, color correlations should not be 
		confused with an exact dye lot match. Commercial textile printing 
		techniques makes exact dye lot matches between various designs 
		frequently impossible. The real color test for these fabrics is how well 
		they look when installed in your room setting.</p>
		
		<p class="termspara"><b>MULTIPLE WIDTH DRAPERIES.</b> Although in printing every effort is made to 
		avoid distortion, occasionally it will exist. Therefore, when planning 
		multiple width draperies, please make certain before cutting, that the 
		pattern alignment is adequate to produce a satisfactory end result.</p>
		
		<p class="termspara"><b>DRAPERIES.</b> Be tolerant of small fluctuations in length. No fabric is 
		completely stable. It is reasonable to expect a 3% change in any drapery 
		length depending on the fabric involved. Drapery fabrics, due to yarn 
		contents, construction, humidity, etc., will expand or contract under 
		certain atmospheric conditions. You should allow sufficient fabric in 
		the hems for later adjustments, should it be necessary.</p>
		
		<p class="termspara"><b>F.O.B.:</b> Moorpark, CA</p>
		
		<p class="termspara"><b>RETURNS &amp; CLAIMS.</b> No returns accepted without a return authorization 
		number. All authorized returns without fault of the vendor will be 
		subject to a 25% restocking charge, plus freight both ways. No piece 
		less than ten (10) yards on drapery and five (5) yards on upholstery 
		will be accepted under any circumstances. No fabrics with special 
		finishes will be accepted for return. No returns will be accepted after 
		30 days from the date of shipment. All authorized returns must be in the 
		original wrapping materials in the same condition received by Buyer. 
		Your request for return authorization must include the invoice number, 
		date of invoice, pattern, color, yardage and reason. Fabric can not be 
		returned for credit after it has been cut. Yardage must be inspected for 
		flaws, correctness of color, pattern, quantity and quality before 
		cutting as no allowance will be made for cut fabric. When shipments are 
		made direct to workrooms it is your responsibility to send a cutting to 
		the workroom to enable them to verify the goods are correct before 
		processing. No claims or returns will be accepted for drop shipments 
		made per customers’ request. All authorized returns for “damaged” fabric 
		will be subject to inspection. Since color variation often can not be 
		avoided from one dye lot to another, we do not guarantee dye lots, and 
		can issue no credit for dye lot variation unless a cutting for approval 
		was requested with the order. Refused shipments, customer duplication of 
		orders, or cancellations after shipment has been made are subject to a 
		25% restocking charge and all freight charges. No fabric can be returned 
		for credit if it has been processed by the purchaser in any way. Fabric 
		damage or failure due to color fading, pilling or shrinking is not valid 
		where there is evidence of heavy soiling, abuse, or improper cleaning.</p>
		
		<p class="termspara"><b>HANDLOOMED AND NATURAL FIBER FABRICS.</b> Handwoven and natural fiber 
		fabrics may have slight variation in weave and color which are not to be 
		considered flaws. These variations are inherent to handloom textiles and 
		natural fiber fabrics and are part of their unique character. The 
		characteristics slubs enhance its natural beauty and texture. This 
		texture is produced through a natural processing in carding, spinning 
		and weaving. In many cases, the color is natural and not dyed. Because 
		of variations in dyelots, yarns and weaves, the fabric in stock may vary 
		from samples, we recommend a cutting from current stock be required. No 
		guarantees are made regarding colorfastness, fading or exact matching. 
		All measurements quoted for repeats are approximate. Side matching of 
		repeats on ikats, stripes, checks, plaids and ribbed patterns will not 
		be exact.</p>
		
		<p class="termspara"><b>FADING.</b> The best available dyes are used, but our fabrics are not 
		guaranteed against color fading through exposure to the sun or 
		atmospheric conditions. Some colors are more fugitive than others. 
		Colors can fade by oxidation, “gas fading,” if fabrics are kept in 
		storage for too long a period without airing. Impurities in the air may 
		cause as much fading as the direct rays of the sun.</p>
		
		<p class="termspara"><b>MEMO SAMPLES.</b> Loan samples are available at all our showrooms. We do not 
		guarantee to match colors. If these memo samples are not returned within 
		30 days they will be billed and not accepted for credit after due date. 
		The return date from memo samples may be extended upon request.</p>
		
		<p class="termspara"><b>CAUTION.</b> Due to the possibility of differences in dye lots, we 
		recommended that all fabrics necessary to complete the job be in your 
		possession before any work is started. Paints and special dye jobs 
		should be made up to match actual fabrics, not sample equipment. No 
		claims will be recognized on fabric after it has been in any way 
		processed by the purchaser. We do not guarantee to match colors. If an 
		exact match is required, a cutting of current stock should be requested. 
		No fabric will be accepted for return due to dye lot variation.</p>
		
		<p class="termspara"><b>WARRANTY AND LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.</b> Seller warrants that the 
		merchandise will, at the time it is delivered to Buyer, be free from 
		defects in materials or workmanship, within generally accepted industry 
		standards. This warranty is in lieu of all other warranties with respect 
		to the merchandise, including any implied warranties of merchantability 
		or fitness. Any claim under this warranty shall be deemed waived unless 
		made in writing within 30 days of receipt of the merchandise by the 
		Buyer and before any part of the merchandise has been used, resold or 
		transferred. Upon Seller’s approval, non-conforming merchandise may be 
		returned to Seller for credit or replacement, at Seller’s option. Seller 
		expressly disclaims any responsibility for and is not liable to Buyer

		variances in and/or damage to merchandise to which any after-market 
		finish and/or treatment has been applied (e.g., Teflon, Flame Proofing, 
		Laminating, Paper or Acrylic Backing, Soil and Stain Protection, etc.). 
		In no event shall Seller’s liability exceed the amount paid by Buyer to 
		Seller for the non-conforming merchandise. In no event shall Seller be 
		liable for any failure or delay in delivery of all or any part of the 
		merchandise, due, in whole or part, to lockouts, labor disputes, 
		production or transportation interruptions or limitations, shortages or 
		delays in delivery or receipt of materials, acts of God or any other 
		cause beyond Seller’s economically reasonable control. In no event may 
		any action be brought against Seller more than one (1) year after the 
		merchandise was delivered to Buyer.</p>
		
		<p class="termspara"><b>VENUE.</b> All sale and purchase agreements, purchase orders and invoices 
		are made and performed in Moorpark, California, and shall be interpreted 
		and construed in accordance with the laws of California. Any action 
		brought to resolve a dispute arising from the interpretation or 
		construction of or to enforce any such agreement, purchase order and/or 
		invoice shall be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in Ventura 
		County, California and the parties consent to venue and jurisdiction of 
		such courts.</p>
